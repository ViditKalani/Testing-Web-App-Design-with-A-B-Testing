# Testing Web App Design with A/B Testing

Our web app can be found at: https://mail929.github.io/MU-COSC4500-Project/webpage/

We sought to test how users of different types interacted with a website displaying public transit stations. Subjects 
were asked to identify stations in different economic areas, while we also tracked their interactions based on their 
handedness, age, and more general demographic information. The results were largely inconclusive, showing that different
demographics behave largely the same.
